## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, report vulnerabilities by emailing the maintainers at the address listed on the GitHub profile, or by using [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/metyatech/thread-inbox/security/advisories/new).

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and provide a timeline for a fix. Once the vulnerability is resolved, we will publish a security advisory.
